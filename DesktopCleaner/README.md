This Python script organizes files in your Downloads folder by moving them into specific folders based on their file type (e.g., Images, Documents, Audio, etc.). Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from here.

To install any external libraries, you can use pip from the terminal:

'''
pip install pathlib 
'''
