This project is a desktop cleaning tool designed to help users efficiently organize and manage their files by automating the process of cleaning up the desktop. Using Python, the tool scans the desktop directory, categorizes files, and moves them to their respective folders based on user-defined rules. It aims to improve desktop organization and productivity, offering a simple yet effective solution for maintaining a clutter-free workspace.
